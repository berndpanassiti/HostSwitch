\title{Survival probability of the parasite}
\usage{
survivalProbability(pInd, pHost, sigma)
}
\arguments{
\item{pInd}{Phenotype of parasite #(optimum phenotype of parasite on the current host)}

\item{pHost}{Phenotype of resource #(optimum phenotype of parasite on the new host)}

\item{sigma}{Selection intensity}
}
\value{
The survival probability of the parasite
}
\description{
Survival probability of the parasite
}
\details{
The use of this function is calculate the survival probability of the parasite. It is the core function of \code{\link{simHostSwitch}}.
The function is based on the density of the normal distribution: Ignoring  (1/sqrt(2*pi)*sigma) from the density function of the normal distribution, provides us the survival probability.
If both pInd and pHost are equal (pInd = pHost = 5) - as it is defined as being the initial condition of the simHostSwitch function with the parasite having the optimum phenotype - the survival probability equals 1.
