\title{Survival probability of the parasite in a new host (novel resource)}
\usage{
survivalProbability(pInd, pHost, sigma)
}
\arguments{
\item{pInd}{Phenotype of parasite #(Phenotype of ith parasite attempting to disperse in a new host)}

\item{pHost}{Phenotype of resource #(The optimum phenotype the parasite should have to maximize the colonization success)}

\item{sigma}{Selection intensity #(standard deviation of selection intensity)}
}
\value{
The survival probability of the parasite
}
\description{
Survival probability of the parasite in a new host (novel resource)
}
\details{
This function calculates the survival probability of individual parasites that attempt dispersal in a new host. It is the core function of \code{\link{simHostSwitch}}.
The function is based on the probability density function of a normal distribution. By ignoring the  normalization constant \eqn{(1/sqrt(2*pi)*sigma)}, it provides then the survival probability.
}
\examples{
## Example 1a - The ith parasite has the phenotype that maximize its colonization success on the new host, then pInd is equal to pHost (pInd = pHost), and the survival probability is 1.
survivalProbability(pInd=5,pHost=5,sigma=1)

## Example 1b - Increasing |pInd-pHost| the survival probability decreases
survivalProbability(pInd=5,pHost=30,sigma=1)

## Example 1c - Give a |pInd-pHost|> 1, increases sigma the survival probability increases
survivalProbability(pInd=5,pHost=30,sigma=1)
