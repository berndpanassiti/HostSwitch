Description: The 'HostSwitch' package uses a simulation-based approach to investigate host switches by consumers.
    The individual based model is based on the concepts of Stockholm paradigm and ecological fitting.
    The original model is published by Araujo et al. 2015. Understanding Host-Switching by Ecological Fitting (<doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0139225>).
    The package provides an R-friendly and modified version of this model which can be applied to different consumer-resource scenarios.
